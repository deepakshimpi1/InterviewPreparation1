If web api return an error in running production system, what steps developer can take to troubleshoot

When a Web API returns an error in a running production system, developers need to perform effective troubleshooting to identify the root cause and address the issue. Here are steps that developers can take to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Server Logs:**
   - Examine the server logs to gather information about the error.
   - Look for error messages, stack traces, and any other relevant details.
   - Identify the timestamp of the error to correlate it with other events.

2. **Collect Request Information:**
   - Capture details about the incoming request that triggered the error.
   - Include information such as headers, query parameters, and request body.
   - Check for any patterns or specific inputs that might be causing the issue.

3. **Examine Database Queries:**
   - If the API interacts with a database, review the database logs or query performance.
   - Check for database-related errors, slow queries, or connection issues.
   - Identify if the issue is related to data retrieval or updates.

4. **Monitor Dependencies:**
   - If the API relies on external services or dependencies, check their status.
   - Monitor logs and metrics for those services to identify any issues.
   - Verify network connectivity and response times for external dependencies.

5. **Analyze Performance Metrics:**
   - Review performance metrics for the API, such as response times and resource utilization.
   - Identify any sudden spikes in traffic or resource consumption that correlate with the error.
   - Use performance monitoring tools to gain insights into system behavior.

6. **Use Exception Handling:**
   - Implement detailed exception handling within the code to capture specific error conditions.
   - Log exception details, including the type of exception, stack trace, and relevant context information.
   - Include custom error messages that provide insights into the issue.

7. **Debugging in Development Environment:**
   - If possible, reproduce the error in a development or staging environment.
   - Attach a debugger to the running API process to step through the code and identify the point of failure.
   - Debugging in a controlled environment can provide valuable insights.

8. **Error Reproduction:**
   - If the error is sporadic or hard to reproduce, work with users or support to gather more information.
   - Ask for specific steps or inputs that lead to the error.
   - Use logging or monitoring tools to capture additional details during error occurrences.

9. **Review Recent Deployments:**
   - Check if there were recent deployments or changes to the production environment.
   - Verify if the error coincides with a new release or configuration change.
   - Rollback recent changes if they are suspected to be the cause.

10. **Look for Patterns:**
    - Analyze if the error is occurring for specific users, devices, or under certain conditions.
    - Identify patterns that might help isolate the root cause.
    - Check for any recent changes in user behavior or system load.

11. **Engage Support and Operations Teams:**
    - Collaborate with support and operations teams to gather additional information.
    - Utilize communication channels to coordinate efforts in addressing the issue.
    - Share relevant findings and work together on a resolution.

12. **Implement Monitoring Alerts:**
    - Set up monitoring alerts for critical errors and abnormal system behavior.
    - Define thresholds that trigger alerts for specific error conditions.
    - Ensure that the operations team is notified promptly.

13. **Update Documentation:**
    - If the troubleshooting process uncovers undocumented features or behavior, update documentation accordingly.
    - Document the steps taken to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

14. **Post-Mortem Analysis:**
    - Conduct a post-mortem analysis to review the incident, identify root causes, and determine preventive measures.
    - Document lessons learned and update procedures to avoid similar issues in the future.
Remember, effective troubleshooting often involves a combination of technical skills, collaboration with other teams, and attention to detail. Communication with users and stakeholders is also important to keep them informed about the investigation and resolution progress.

## FQDN

FQDN stands for Fully Qualified Domain Name. It is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). An FQDN includes the host name and all its parent domain names up to the top-level domain (TLD). The format is typically "hostname.domain.tld".

Here's a breakdown of the components in an FQDN:

- **Hostname:** The specific name assigned to a device or node within the domain.
- **Domain:** A broader grouping of devices or nodes. It represents a section of the DNS namespace.
- **Top-Level Domain (TLD):** The highest level in the DNS hierarchy, such as ".com," ".org," ".net," or a country code TLD like ".uk."

For example, in the FQDN "www.example.com":

- Hostname: www
- Domain: example
- TLD: com

### Use of FQDN in Web API:

1. **Server Identification:**
   - FQDN is used to uniquely identify the server hosting a Web API.
   - It helps clients locate and connect to the correct server in a network.

2. **DNS Resolution:**
   - Clients use DNS to resolve the FQDN to an IP address.
   - The FQDN serves as a human-readable and meaningful identifier for the server.

3. **SSL/TLS Certificates:**
   - FQDN is often associated with SSL/TLS certificates used for secure communication (HTTPS).
   - SSL/TLS certificates are bound to specific FQDNs, ensuring secure connections to the correct domain.

4. **Load Balancing:**
   - In scenarios involving load balancing, FQDNs are used to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
   - Clients connect to the load balancer's FQDN, which then forwards requests to backend servers.

5. **API Endpoint Identification:**
   - FQDN is used to specify the endpoint of a Web API.
   - It helps create a clear and standardized API endpoint, making it accessible via a well-defined domain.

6. **API Versioning:**
   - FQDN can be part of API versioning strategies by incorporating version information in the domain.
   - For example, "api.v1.example.com" and "api.v2.example.com" might represent different API versions.

7. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
   - When dealing with cross-origin requests, FQDN plays a role in CORS policies.
   - It helps define which domains are allowed to make requests to the API.

8. **Service Discovery:**
   - In microservices architectures, FQDNs can be used for service discovery.
   - Services register themselves with FQDNs, allowing other services to locate and communicate with them.

In summary, FQDNs are essential for identifying and accessing Web APIs on the internet or within a network. They provide a human-readable and standardized way to refer to specific servers or API endpoints.

## Session management

Session management refers to the process of maintaining stateful information about a user's interactions with a web application across multiple requests. In the context of ASP.NET, session management can be handled using different modes, specifically "InProc" (in-process) and "OutProc" (out-of-process).

### InProc (In-Process) Session Management:

- **Storage Location:** InProc session management stores session data within the same process (in-memory) as the web application.
- **Advantages:**
  - Fast and efficient access to session data since it's stored in memory.
  - No external dependencies or additional configurations needed.
- **Considerations:**
  - Limited scalability: As the session data is stored in the application's memory, it can impact scalability, especially in a web farm or server farm scenario.
  - Data loss: If the application restarts or recycles, the session data is lost.

### OutProc (Out-of-Process) Session Management:

- **Storage Location:** OutProc session management stores session data outside the web application process.
- **Storage Options:**
  - **State Server:** Session data is stored in a separate "state server" process.
  - **SQL Server:** Session data is stored in a SQL Server database.
  - **Custom Provider:** Developers can implement custom session state providers.
- **Advantages:**
  - Improved scalability: Multiple web servers can share session data stored externally.
  - Resilience: Session data survives application restarts or recycles.
- **Considerations:**
  - Slower access compared to InProc: Accessing session data may involve inter-process communication, which can introduce some latency.
  - Additional configuration: Requires setting up and configuring an external state server or database.

### Choosing Between InProc and OutProc:

- **Scale:** If scalability is a critical factor and the application needs to run on multiple servers, OutProc is often preferred.
- **Performance:** For smaller applications or single-server setups, InProc may provide better performance due to direct in-memory access.
- **Resilience:** If the application needs to survive restarts or recycles, OutProc is a more resilient option.

### Configuration in ASP.NET:

Configuring the session mode is done in the `web.config` file:

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.web>
    <sessionState mode="InProc" /> <!-- or mode="StateServer" or mode="SQLServer" -->
  </system.web>
</configuration>
```

In this example, `mode` can be set to "InProc," "StateServer," or "SQLServer" based on the chosen session management mode.

Remember, the choice between InProc and OutProc depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your web application, including factors like scalability, performance, and resilience.

## If you are developing web api and you want to secure your web api from hacker. what security steps you consider while implementing and hosting your web api?

Securing a Web API is a critical aspect of development to protect against potential threats and attacks. Here are key security considerations and steps to take when implementing and hosting a Web API:

1. **Use HTTPS (TLS/SSL):**
   - Always use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between clients and the server.
   - Configure your web server with a valid SSL/TLS certificate.
   - This ensures that communication is secure and helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **Authentication:**
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of clients.
   - Use protocols like OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for authentication and authorization.
   - Leverage token-based authentication (JWT) for stateless authentication.

3. **Authorization:**
   - Enforce proper access controls and authorization mechanisms.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
   - Validate permissions before allowing access to resources.

4. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate and sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks.
   - Implement server-side validation to ensure that only valid and expected data is processed.

5. **Parameterized Queries:**
   - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection attacks.

6. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection:**
   - Sanitize and validate user input to prevent XSS attacks.
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to control which resources can be loaded.

7. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
   - Implement proper CORS settings to control which domains are allowed to access your API.
   - Validate and restrict the origins that can make requests to your API.

8. **Secure File Uploads:**
   - If your API allows file uploads, ensure that you implement secure file upload practices.
   - Validate file types, limit file sizes, and store files in secure locations.

9. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Implement comprehensive logging to track and monitor API activity.
   - Monitor for suspicious activity and set up alerts for potential security incidents.

10. **Rate Limiting:**
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
    - Restrict the number of requests a client can make within a given time frame.

11. **Security Headers:**
    - Use security headers, such as Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options, to enhance security.
    - Set proper headers to control caching behavior and prevent information leakage.

12. **Dependency Scanning:**
    - Regularly scan and update dependencies, libraries, and frameworks to address security vulnerabilities.
    - Keep all software components up to date.

13. **API Versioning:**
    - Implement proper versioning of your API to ensure backward compatibility.
    - Avoid exposing sensitive information in error responses.

14. **Encrypted Secrets:**
    - Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) securely.
    - Use environment variables or a secure configuration management solution to manage secrets.

15. **Security Testing:**
    - Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews.
    - Use tools like Veracode, OWASP ZAP or other security scanners to identify vulnerabilities.

16. **Regular Security Audits:**
    - Perform regular security audits and assessments to identify and address potential security risks.
    - Engage with third-party security experts for independent assessments.

17. **Educate Development Team:**
    - Provide security training to the development team to raise awareness about common security issues.
    - Foster a security-aware culture within the development process.

18. **Compliance:**
    - Ensure compliance with relevant security standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) depending on the nature of your application.

## AddTransient, AddScoped and AddSingleton Services Differences

Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38138100/addtransient-addscoped-and-addsingleton-services-differences

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54889486/addtransientiservice-service-versus-addtransientservice?rq=3

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57659980/does-dbcontext-registered-as-scoped-or-transient-affect-in-closing-database?noredirect=1&lq=1


In .NET Core and ASP.NET Core, `AddTransient`, `AddScoped`, and `AddSingleton` are methods used for registering services with the dependency injection (DI) container. These methods define the lifetime of the service instances created by the container. Here are the key differences between them:

1. **AddTransient:**
   - **Lifetime:** Transient services are created each time they are requested. A `new instance is provided for each request`.
   - **Usage:** Suitable for lightweight, stateless services that don't need to store any state between method calls.
   - **Example:**
     ```csharp
     services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
     ```

2. **AddScoped:**
   - **Lifetime:** Scoped services are created once per request within the `scope of the HTTP request`. They are shared across all components that participate in handling the same HTTP request.
   - **Usage:** Ideal for services that need to maintain state during the lifetime of a single HTTP request, such as handling per-request data or caching.
   - **Example:**
     ```csharp
     services.AddScoped<IScopedService, ScopedService>();
     ```

3. **AddSingleton:**
   - **Lifetime:** Singleton services are created once and shared throughout the `application's lifetime`. They are instantiated the first time they are requested and reused for all subsequent requests.
   - **Usage:** Suitable for stateless or stateful services that are expensive to create and can be shared safely across different parts of the application.
   - **Example:**
     ```csharp
     services.AddSingleton<ISingletonService, SingletonService>();
     ```

### Comparison Example:

Let's illustrate the difference using a scenario where we have a counter service.

```csharp
public interface ICounterService
{
    int Increment();
}

public class CounterService : ICounterService
{
    private int count;

    public int Increment()
    {
        return ++count;
    }
}
```

#### Registering Services:

```csharp
// Transient
services.AddTransient<ICounterService, CounterService>();

// Scoped
services.AddScoped<ICounterService, CounterService>();

// Singleton
services.AddSingleton<ICounterService, CounterService>();
```

#### Using Services in a Controller:

```csharp
public class CounterController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ICounterService transientCounter;
    private readonly ICounterService scopedCounter;
    private readonly ICounterService singletonCounter;

    public CounterController(
        ICounterService transientCounter,
        ICounterService scopedCounter,
        ICounterService singletonCounter)
    {
        this.transientCounter = transientCounter;
        this.scopedCounter = scopedCounter;
        this.singletonCounter = singletonCounter;
    }

    [HttpGet("transient")]
    public IActionResult GetTransientCount()
    {
        return Ok(transientCounter.Increment());
    }

    [HttpGet("scoped")]
    public IActionResult GetScopedCount()
    {
        return Ok(scopedCounter.Increment());
    }

    [HttpGet("singleton")]
    public IActionResult GetSingletonCount()
    {
        return Ok(singletonCounter.Increment());
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `transientCounter` will be a new instance for each request.
- The `scopedCounter` will be shared within the same HTTP request but different for subsequent requests.
- The `singletonCounter` will be shared across all requests and is the same instance throughout the application's lifetime.


### Statelessness in Transient Services:

**Transient services** are created anew for each request or usage. They are stateless in the sense that there is no shared state between different requests or method calls. Each time a transient service is requested, a new instance is created, and any data or state maintained by that instance is specific to that particular request.

`Example:` Consider a service responsible for generating a random number. Each time you request this service, it provides a new random number, and there is no shared state between different requests.

### Statefulness in Scoped Services:

**Scoped services** are created once per scope, typically per HTTP request in the case of a web application. While they maintain state within a single request, they are stateless between different requests. The state is shared within the scope, making them suitable for scenarios where you want to maintain information or state specific to a user's interaction within a request.

`Example:` A shopping cart service in a web application can be scoped. It maintains the state of the user's shopping cart throughout the entire request but is independent of other users' requests.

### Shared State in Singleton Services:

**Singleton services** are created once and shared across the entire application. They are stateful in the sense that any data or state stored in a singleton is shared among all components that use the singleton. This makes them suitable for scenarios where you want to share state or data across various parts of the application.

`Example:` A configuration service that reads application settings from a file can be a singleton. It loads the settings once and provides the same configuration to all parts of the application.

### Statelessness vs. Shared State:

- **Stateless Services:** These are typically transient and don't maintain any state between different requests or method calls. They are suitable for operations where each request is independent and doesn't rely on shared information.

- **Stateful Services:** Scoped services are stateful within a request, while singleton services are stateful across the entire application. They are suitable when you need to maintain shared information, configuration, or state between different parts of the application.


### **Note**

### Question: Does DbContext registered as "scoped" or "transient" affect in closing database connection


I have a basic understanding in DI in ASP.NET MVC, but there is a question that bothers me a lot. Does it make any difference to register DbContext as 'scoped' or "transient"? Below is some code of a typical mvc application:

```c#
public class EmployeeController : Controller
{
    private EmployeeContext _context;

    public EmployeeController(EmployeeContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        return View(context.Employees.ToList());
    }
    
    ...//other action methods that access context's DbSet
}
```

Let's say we register EmployeeContext as a transient service. After we run the application, the application is listening any incoming requests. Let's say a http request to default /Home/Index occurs so a new instance of EmployeeController  needs to be created. DI will provide an instance of EmployeeContext to the controller's constructor first. _context is available for all other action methods too and there is not any other place need to create a new EmployeeContext service.

So after the request is finished, the _context is disposed too. Isn't it the same effect as a scoped service? We meant to register it as "transient" service and in the end it works like a "scoped" service. It seems if really doesn't matter if we register Dbcontext as "scoped" or "transient".


### Answer: 

If you don't use any other injected services (which are also using your DBContext) there's no difference between scoped and transient.

But if you use other injected services, with "transient" on the DBContext, every service gets his own instance of it. In order to avoid that you should always use "scoped" on the DBContext.

In your example with the following code, with a "transient" EmployeeContext there will be two instances every request:
```c#
public class MyService : IMyService 
{
 public MyService(EmployeeContext context)
 {
  // ...
 }
}

public class EmployeeController : Controller
{
    private EmployeeContext _context;
    private _myService;

    public EmployeeController(EmployeeContext context, IMyService myService)
    {
        _context = context;
        _myService = myService;
    }

    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        return View(context.Employees.ToList());
    }

    ...//other action methods that access context's DbSet
}
```

## Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET Core

Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET Core is implemented through the built-in dependency injection container provided by the framework. The DI container is responsible for creating and managing the instances of the application's services and making sure that dependencies are resolved and injected where needed. Here's how DI is implemented in .NET Core:

### 1. Service Registration:

In the startup configuration (typically in the `Startup` class), services are registered with the dependency injection container. This is where you specify the relationships between interfaces and their concrete implementations, as well as the lifetime of the service instances.

Example of service registration in `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Transient Service
    services.AddTransient<ITransientService, TransientService>();

    // Scoped Service
    services.AddScoped<IScopedService, ScopedService>();

    // Singleton Service
    services.AddSingleton<ISingletonService, SingletonService>();
}
```

### 2. Dependency Injection:

Once services are registered, the container takes care of injecting dependencies into the constructors of classes that request them. This is often referred to as constructor injection.

Example of dependency injection in a controller:

```csharp
public class MyController : Controller
{
    private readonly ITransientService transientService;
    private readonly IScopedService scopedService;
    private readonly ISingletonService singletonService;

    public MyController(
        ITransientService transientService,
        IScopedService scopedService,
        ISingletonService singletonService)
    {
        this.transientService = transientService;
        this.scopedService = scopedService;
        this.singletonService = singletonService;
    }

    // Controller actions...
}
```

In this example, the controller's constructor is requesting services through its constructor parameters, and the DI container provides the appropriate instances.

### 3. Service Lifetimes:

.NET Core supports three main service lifetimes: Transient, Scoped, and Singleton.

- **Transient:** A new instance is created each time it's requested.
- **Scoped:** A single instance is created for each scope, typically corresponding to an HTTP request in a web application.
- **Singleton:** A single instance is created and shared across the entire application's lifetime.

### 4. Automatic Injection:

The DI container can automatically resolve and inject dependencies into controllers, services, middleware, and other components. This is achieved through constructor injection or property injection.

Example of automatic injection in a controller:

```csharp
public class MyController : Controller
{
    // Automatic injection of services through constructor
    public MyController(ITransientService transientService, IScopedService scopedService)
    {
        // ...
    }

    // Automatic injection of services through property
    [FromServices]
    public ISingletonService SingletonService { get; set; }

    // Controller actions...
}
```

### 5. Customizing DI Container:

The built-in DI container in .NET Core is flexible, but for more advanced scenarios, you can replace it with a third-party container like Autofac or Ninject. This allows you to customize the DI container behavior.

### Summary:

Dependency Injection in .NET Core simplifies the management of object dependencies by providing a built-in container that resolves and injects dependencies automatically. It promotes modular and testable code, making it easier to maintain and extend applications. The process involves service registration, dependency injection, and specifying the lifetimes of services.
